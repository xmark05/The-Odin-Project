# The-Odin-Project
This is a repository for 'The Odin Project' so I can work on it at both home and work, and track my progress.

I don’t think I’ll post all the exercises here because I might forget or because they might be too simple or too short. Let’s see how far I get! (: If you see any mistakes, I’d be grateful if you could let me know, and also any tips on doing things more efficiently. Thanks! The best way to reach me is on Discord; it should be listed somewhere on my profile. You could also contact me through GitHub, but I’m not quite sure how (you probably know a bit more about that than I do)
